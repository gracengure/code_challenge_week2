## Description
     Solution 1
This function  used  accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

    Solution 2
This JavaScript function used accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output will be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 will return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

   Solution 3
The function used takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.  This function efficiently, ensures that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appeared in the input array. For example if the provided  array  is[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
